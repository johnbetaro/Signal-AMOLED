- Replaced the classic dark theme with pure black theme.
- The App is fully changed, built, signed, released by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/JohnBetaro/Signal-Android-AMOLED/actions) (without any human intervention), all of this is for the sake of transparency. The [workflow file](https://github.com/JohnBetaro/Signal-AMOLED/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) that I made will automatically check for updates everyday and will publish an update if there is any.
